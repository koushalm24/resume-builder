## About
This GitHub repository hosts a Resume Builder web application developed using React JS. The purpose of this application is to simplify the process of creating professional resumes. With this app, users can easily select a template, fill in their details, and generate a well-structured resume.

## Working
1. **Select a Template**: The app provides a selection of professionally designed resume templates to choose from. Users can pick a template that suits their preferences and needs.

2. **Fill in Details**: Once a template is selected, users can fill in their personal and professional details. The app provides input fields for information such as name, contact details, work experience, education, skills, and more.

3. **Generate Resume**: After entering all the necessary information, users can click a button to generate their resume. The app will dynamically format the data into the selected template, creating a visually appealing and well-organized resume.

4. **Preview and Download**: Users can preview the generated resume to ensure everything looks as expected. Once satisfied, they can download the resume in a standard format (e.g., PDF) for easy sharing with potential employers.
